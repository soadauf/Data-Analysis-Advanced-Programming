This analysis elucidates the shared biomarkers between COVID-19 and Alzheimer’s disease, 
identifying specific pathway dysregulations that indicate their bidirectional risk. The integration 
of differential gene expression with pathway enrichment reveals two critical mechanisms including 
vascular and adrenergic stress highlighted in the upregulation of ADRA1D that is highly linked to 
the increased calcium channel activity observed in MAPK signaling pathway of both conditions. 
Additionally, inflammatory dysregulation where the suppression of SERPINA3 correlates with a 
hyper-activated TNF signaling pathway, confirming that the loss of this protease inhibitor fuels 
the cytokine storm via Ccl2, Cxcl1. To summarize, these findings provide molecular evidence that 
SARS-CoV-2 infection increases neurodegenerative risks through specific, identifiable pathways, 
highlighting ADRA1D and SERPINA3 as potential therapeutic targets to mitigate post-infectious 
cognitive decline.
